This project focuses on developing a plant disease detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify and classify diseases affecting the 
leaves of various plants, including potato, tomato, and pepper bell. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we aim to assist farmers and plant enthusiasts in detecting and diagnosing plant diseases more effectively.
We use the PlantVillage dataset, which is available on Kaggle.com, for training and testing our model. This dataset contains a comprehensive collection of images of plant leaves affected by various diseases. By leveraging this dataset, we can train our machine learning model to recognize and classify different types of plant diseases accurately.
The focus of this project is on detecting several common diseases that affect the leaves of plants. Some of the targeted diseases include:

Bacterial Spot, 
Early Blight, 
Septoria Leaf Spot, 
spider mite spot, 
These diseases are prevalent in potato, tomato, and pepper bell plants, and accurate detection can help in timely intervention and prevention of crop damage.
